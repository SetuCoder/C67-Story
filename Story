Once there was a forest, in which there were animals living happily. 
There were two friends, a hare and a tortise, which always used to brag how fast it could run. But the poor tortise, because of it's heavy shell, couldn't run as fast as the hare.
One fine day, the hare challenged the tortise for a race between them. The tortise was confused, very sure that the hare would win as it is faster than him.
He said the same to the hare, but the hare wanted to show his ability to everyone else in the public and critisize the tortise.


He insisted him to participate, so nothing left to do, the tortise agreed. 
This was the day of the race, the rabbit vey enthusiasticly, was getting ready for the race and so was the tortise.

Hare ran down the road for a while and then paused to rest.
He looked back at Slow and Steady and cried out, "How do you expect to win this race when you are walking along at your slow, slow pace?"
