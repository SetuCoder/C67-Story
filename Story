Once there was a forest, in which there were animals living happily. 
There were two friends, a hare and a tortise, which always used to brag how fast it could run. But the poor tortise, because of it's heavy shell, couldn't run as fast as the hare.
One fine day, the hare challenged the tortise for a race between them. The tortise was confused, very sure that the hare would win as it is faster than him.
He said the same to the hare, but the hare wanted to show his ability to everyone else in the public and critisize the tortise.


He insisted him to participate, so nothing left to do, the tortise agreed.
